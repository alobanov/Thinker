<b>‚ÑπÔ∏è Parser for evaluating logic expressions.</b>
</p>

For example we have string like `44 >= 43 || 22 == 12`, you need to evaluate this expression and take  a boolean result. So give that line for `thinker` and BOOM you have a result. Example: `let result = ThinkerEvaluater().evaluate(srt)`

## Features

- [x] Work with types:
   - [x] Numeric constants, as floating point (12345.678)
   - [x] String constants (single quotes: \`foobar\`)
   - [x] Boolean constants: `true` `false`
- [x] Comparison operators: `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- [x] Logic operators: `&&`, `||`
- [x] Map value from json, for example `prefix.node.nestedValue`, `var.` will be replaced value from dictionary by key `node.nestedValue`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Parenthesis to control order of evaluation `(` `)`
- [ ] Ternary conditional: `?` `:`
- [ ] Modifiers: `+` `-` `/` `*` `&` `|` `^` `**` `%` `>>` `<<`

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `thinker` in action. Simply open the `thinker.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Usage

```swift
let instance = ThinkerEvaluater()
    
XCTAssertEqual(instance.evaluate("2 == 2") ?? false, true) // Int
XCTAssertEqual(instance.evaluate("-122.321 == -122.321") ?? false, true) // Doube
XCTAssertEqual(instance.evaluate("false != true") ?? false, true) // Boolean
XCTAssertEqual(instance.evaluate("`asd` != `ads`") ?? false, true) // String
XCTAssertEqual(instance.evaluate("`milk` == `milk` && 2 >= 1 || true == true") ?? false, true) // Composite expression
```

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate thinker into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "alobanov/thinker"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `thinker.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://alobanov@github.com/alobanov/Thinker-evaluater.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `thinker`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate thinker into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
